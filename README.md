## The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows:
– We proposed strategies to address each limitation of Rating_Jaccard to obtain better extensions of Jaccard similarity.
– We verifed the efectiveness of each proposed strategy in detail using several datasets and determined the best similarity among the proposed Jaccard similarity extensions, considering the prediction performance and computation time.
– RJAC_DUB, which was determined as the best similarity among the proposed ones in this study, considered the rating information and inherently users’ rating preference behavior in the similarity calculation.
– Through extensive experiments based on various datasets, we demonstrated the superiority of the proposed similarity over existing variations of Jaccard similarity and other similarity measures.

## Comparison results of the proposed similarity measures : MAE
